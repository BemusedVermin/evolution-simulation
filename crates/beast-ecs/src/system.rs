//! `System` trait and `SystemStage` enum (S5.3 — issue #102).
//!
//! Models the eight-stage tick loop in
//! `documentation/architecture/ECS_SCHEDULE.md`. A [`SystemStage`] groups
//! systems that the scheduler will run sequentially between stages and in
//! parallel within a stage (S6 wires up the scheduler; this module just
//! defines the surface).
//!
//! The [`Resources`] type is a placeholder until S5.4 lands — it holds no
//! state today. That keeps this module independent of S5.4 so each story
//! can ship its own PR.
